This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in HTML related to modifying the text content of a div element. The bug arises from using the incorrect property to change the text within the div.  The 'text' property is not a standard way to modify a div's content; instead, 'innerHTML' or 'textContent' should be used. This difference can cause silent failure, especially in browsers with stricter error handling.  The solution demonstrates the correct approach to avoid this issue.
